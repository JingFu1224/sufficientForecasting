Description: The sufficient forecasting (SF) method is implemented by this package for 
    a single time series forecasting using many predictors and a possibly nonlinear 
    forecasting function. Assuming that the predictors are driven by some latent 
    factors, the SF first conducts factor analysis and then performs sufficient 
    dimension reduction on the estimated factors to derive predictive indices for 
    forecasting. The package implements several dimension reduction approaches, 
    including principal components (PC), sliced inverse regression (SIR), and 
    directional regression (DR).
